      <h3><strong>Beware of <em>Debt Shuffle</em> programs</strong></h3>
      <br /> 
      <p>There are numerous companies selling <em>“debt elimination”</em> <em>“debt elimination”</em> and <em>“mortgage amortization acceleration” software products</em> at exorbitant prices: United First Financial (also known as: U1st or UFirst Financial); Sydney Financial Group, Harj Gill, Equity Genie, among others. Their <em>products</em> go by various names: Money Merge Account (MMA); Mortgage Checking Account (MCA); Mortgage Elimination System, etc.</p>

      <p>They all recommend shuffling debt from a mortgage account to an HELOC account (some even recommend using a credit card!), and using the HELOC account as a checking account in order to “take advantage” of the average daily balance. (They also often describe the <em>average daily balance</em> as the <em>"key banking principle"</em> as if it were some sort of banking secret.)</p>

      <p>The concept behind using a HELOC (or even a primary mortgage - if it is an <i>open-line-of-credit</i> with checking account features) as a debt-based checking account is this: Since interest is charged on the <i>average daily balance</i> (ADB), if you lower the ADB - even temporarily, then you will lower the interest cost. </p>

      <p>To employ this concept, you would begin by borrowing from an HELOC account and paying down the primary mortgage. You then deposit all your income into, and pay all your expenses from, the HELOC account. While your <i>floating income</i> (income that comes in, sits for a while, and then goes out to pay bills) temporarily lowers the HELOC balance (its <i>average daily balance</i>), your <i>discretionary income</i> permanently lowers the balance. Before the HELOC balance becomes negative (from discretionary income), you borrow from it again and pay down the primary mortgage. In other words, you periodically transfer <i>debt</i> from the primary mortgage to the HELOC.</p>

      <p>These companies (selling $3,500 calculators) claim that you can achieve <em>enormous savings</em> by means of lowering the <em>average daily balance</em>.</p>

      <p><em>But this claim is not true!</em></p>

      <p>Let's consider the best case scenario. If you deposit your income on the 1st and pay your mortgage and bills on the 30th of the month, then you will have lowered <strong>as much as possible</strong> the <i>average daily balance</i>. If your income is $5,000 per month and the interest rate (of the HELOC) is 6%, then you can, <b>at most</b>, eliminate $25 interest per month ($5,000*6%/12=$25), which is $300 per year or $3,000 over 10 years.</p>

      <p>So where does the <i>enormous savings</i> come from? From using discretionary (surplus) income to make pre-payments that permanently reduce the mortgage balance.</p>

      <p>In the best case scenario, eliminating $3,000 over ten years doesn't even cover the cost for their $3,500 calculator.</p>

      <p>It gets worse.</p>

      <p>Using a HELOC in this scheme is more likely to cost money than save money <b>because of the average daily balance</b> (ADB). In the real world, the costs of living (rent, food, cars, etc) occur before income is received. Most people pay the mortgage on the 1st of the month and other bills throughout the month, and receive income on the 15th of the month and on the 1st of the next month (most receive income <i>after</i> working for 2 weeks). The only thing reducing the balance, and truly lowering the ADB, is the discretionary (or surplus) income.</p>

      <p>In most cases, <i>using</i> an HELOC actually <b><i>siphons off</i></b> some of the discretionary (surplus) income that could have been used for pre-payments against the primary mortgage.</p>

      <p>These companies also claim that you need their software (with its secret <i>algorithms</i>* and <i>factorial math</i>*) to figure out the optimum transfer amount. But as we have just show that, in most cases, the optimum transfer amount is $0. The optimum course of action is to not use a HELOC at all.</p>

      <p>(*An <i>algorithm</i> is just a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. A <i>factorial</i> is the product of a given positive integer (a whole number) multiplied by all its lesser positive integers. Thus, <i>four factorial</i>, or <i>4!, = 4*3*2*1 = 24</i>. <i>Factorial math</i> is used to find the number of factors or possibilities; such as, for example, the number of different ways to payoff one's debts: lowest balance first, highest interest first, etc.)</p>

      <p>These companies convince their clients that using an HELOC account with their $3,500 calculator helps them save money. But the real reason their clients save money is because they are using discretionary income (minus the expense of the HELOC) to make pre-payments.</p>

      <p>These companies also make one or more the following claims about their programs:</p>
      <div className="enumerated_list_beware">
      <ol>
        <li>that it doesn't require extra  payments or pre-payments, 
      </li>
        <li>that it doesn't require refinancing,</li>
        <li>that it doesn't require a change in cash flow or lifestyle,</li>
        <li>that it doesn't require and that it involves no risk,</li>
        <li>that it and their online software is easy to use,</li>
        <li>that it eliminates interest by making debt transfers mid-month.</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      

      <p>All of these claims are misleading, deceptive, or false.</p> 
      <ol>
        <li>To work at all, their programs require surplus income &amp; pre-payments (which they admit in the <i>fine print</i> of their sales pitch).</li>
        <li>To borrow from one account (HELOC) to pay down another account (mortgage) is to refinance that portion of debt.</li>
        <li>To start pre-paying your mortgage is to change both your lifestyle and your cash flow.</li>
        <li>To carry debt with an adjustable interest rate is very risky. Even a few percentage points can dramatically increase the payment amount, and make the debt unmanageable.</li>
        <li>To use their software is very tiresome and time-consuming, requiring users to enter <i>every single financial transaction <b>and</b> on the date of the transaction</i> in order to calculate the average daily balance. If you have 10 transactions every month, then you must update their software 10 times every month.</li>
        <li>To pre-pay the mortgage mid-month doesn't matter because lenders only apply payment against the principle once a month, on the due date. (Unless your lender agreed, from the start, to credit your account according to a bimonthly payment schedule.) To transfer debt mid-month would actually raise mid-month the <i>average daily balance</i> of the HELOC but not lower the <i>average daily balance</i> of the Mortgage until the first of the next month. (These companies are rather deceitful in their presentation of how <i>average daily balance</i> works.)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Finally, a $3,500 pre-payment would eliminate a lot of interest. A $3,500 pre-payment, on the first term of a 30 year $200,000 loan at 6% interest rate, would eliminate $16,657 in interest.</p>

      <p>$3,500 plus $16,657 equals $20,157. Twenty grand plus the loses to be incurred by using a HELOC in a debt shuffle scheme makes these programs very expensive. These companies are not helping people. <i>Buyer Beware!</i></p>
